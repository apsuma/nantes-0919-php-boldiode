# BOLDIODE
### Discover and manage an hotel in Quiberon.  
A students project at WildCodeSchool (Nantes).

## Description

The aim of this website is to manage an hotel (add/modify/highlight/delete rooms - introduce hotel and his owners to the public - contact hotel team by email sendingform).
The owners of Boldiode Hotel in Quiberon are François and Cecile. They asked us to create this tool for their hotel.



## Steps

1. Clone the repo from Github.
2. Run `composer install`.
3. Create *config/db.php* from *config/db.php.dist* file and add your DB parameters. Don't delete the *.dist* file, it must be kept.
```php
define('APP_DB_HOST', 'your_db_host');
define('APP_DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('APP_DB_USER', 'your_db_user_wich_is_not_root');
define('APP_DB_PWD', 'your_db_password');
define('GMAIL_USER', 'user@gmail.com'); 
define('GMAIL_PWD', 'password');
```

4. Import `bdd.sql` in your SQL server,
5. Run the internal PHP webserver with `php -S localhost:8000 -t public/`. The option `-t` with `public` as parameter means your localhost will target the `/public` folder.
6. Go to `localhost:8000` with your favorite browser.
7. Try to log on admin page (a first admin is created in `bdd.sql`) or just consult the website.
